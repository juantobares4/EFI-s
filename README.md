# Basic React Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic projects developed with React. Each project has its own folder and focuses on different concepts and functionalities of React.

## Projects

1. **Programmer's Blog**
  - A simple blog for programmers where they can share their knowledge and experiences.
  - Uses React Router for handling navigation between different views (article list, article details, create new article, etc.).
  - Implements the `useState` hook for managing the local state of components.
  - Applies the `useEffect` hook for performing side effects, such as fetching data from a server or performing cleanup tasks.

2. **Calculator**
  - A basic calculator with simple arithmetic operations.
  - Utilizes the `useState` hook to maintain the state of the calculator (current value, operation, etc.).
  - Employs functional components and component composition for better modularity.

3. **Game-Javascript**
  - A hangman game developed with JavaScript.
  - Uses the `useState` hook to maintain the state of the game (secret word, guessed letters, remaining attempts, etc.).
  - Applies the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as initializing the game or checking for win/lose conditions.
  - Implements reusable functional components for the game board, letters, hangman drawing, etc.

4. **Todo List**
  - An application for creating and managing to-do lists, with the ability to mark tasks as completed.
  - Utilizes the `useState` hook to maintain the state of tasks (task list, completed tasks, etc.).
  - Applies the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as loading tasks from local storage or saving changes.
  - Implements reusable functional components for the task list, input form, and individual task items.

5. **Simple Ecommerce Page**
  - A basic ecommerce page with a product catalog and a shopping cart.
  - Uses React Router for handling navigation between different views (catalog, product details, cart, etc.).
  - Implements the `useState` hook to maintain the state of the shopping cart and selected products.
  - Applies the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as fetching product data from a server or saving the cart state in local storage.

6. **Card-Pokemos**
  - A "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game with a Pokémon twist, where players choose between Fire, Grass, and Water, represented by the three basic Pokémon from the first generation.
  - Utilizes the `useState` hook to maintain the state of the game (player's choice, computer's choice, result, etc.).
  - Implements reusable functional components for the game board, Pokémon cards, result display, etc.
  - Applies the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as initializing the game or checking for win/lose conditions.

These projects will allow you to explore different concepts and features of React, such as state management, effects, routing, component composition, and more. Each project is designed to be scalable and extensible, providing you with the opportunity to add additional features and enhance your React skills.
